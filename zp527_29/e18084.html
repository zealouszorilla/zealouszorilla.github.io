This book does that. Another strength is the connection of the content to the math processes and practices, the heart of good instruction. The figures provided to summarize big ideas are excellent. I love the potential of this book for using it as a text for middle and secondary teachers, a guide for professional development, and a place for individual reflection. I know for sure that I would use it for my student teacher seminar class and anytime that I was instructing upper level math teachers. I’ve been waiting for this!" -- Barbara Fox, Adjunct Professor, Student Teacher Supervisor"The author provides a solid rationale, backed up by numerous practical and authentic examples to increase the quality of conceptual math classroom teaching practices so needed to develop the next generation learners. This is a must have for any secondary school’s professional library." -- Dave Nagel, Author Consultant"I attended a Concepts Based Curriculum training course led by Jennifer Wathall and was really inspired by what I learned. Far too often, as teachers, we can become narrowly focused on the topics that we are covering; with concepts there is a whole new opportunity for students to understand the big ideas and the connections between different subjects. Jennifer skillfully guided us through how we can introduce students to a concept-based curriculum. I was really impressed with the method of writing principle generalizations which provide a framework for exploration. These generalizations can in fact make the focus of a lesson or series of lessons much more exciting, allowing students to break out of the constraints of a limited topic range. Ultimately, I left the course determined to try out a concepts-based model with a new unit we are developing on Human Rights. With the conceptual lens, this promises to be a much more thought-provoking unit for our students." -- John Edwards, Head of History Department"One of the major strengths of the book is the examples and the visual diagrams that outline major topics. The book provides rubrics that allow teachers to determine where they are in their methodology and a opportunity to decide where they can improve their teaching strategies." -- Amanda McKee, High School Mathematics Instructor"The major strength of the book is that it addresses teaching mathematics in a way that invites students to learn and encourages not only content knowledge, but depth of knowledge, rigor, and critical thinking. Inquiry is a means of synergizing your classroom and drawing students in so that they want to learn. This is going to require a change of mindset for teachers and the administrators alike as well as training. This book provides an opportunity for both." -- Pamela L. Opel, Intervention Specialist"Jennie Wathall’s book offers a clear understanding of how complex learning of mathematics is, and how to use this understanding to create a thinking classroom. She explains, from a scientific point of view and in a very well-researched and comprehensive manner, sprinkled with plenty of practical examples, what is the interdependence between the processes and knowledge and how to plan, run and assess for a concept-based mathematics classroom. This book is a must-read for all mathematics educators, a book that should definitely be on the table in each mathematics office." -- Dr. Daniela Vasile, Head of Mathematics"Wathall is a master at covering all the bases here; this book is bursting with engaging assessment examples, discussion questions, research, and resources that apply specifically to mathematical topics. Any math teacher or coach would be hard-pressed to read it and not come away with scores of ideas, assessments, and lessons that she could use instantly in the classroom.
